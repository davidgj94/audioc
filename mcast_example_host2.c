/* Unicast_multicast communication
THIS IS CODE for host2
compile with
	gcc -Wall -o host2 mcast_example_host2.c
execute as
	./host2
	
host1 uses an unicast localSAddr address.
host2 receives data in a multicast address. It receives from ANY sender.
(If you are testing with many of your mates, you should CHANGE the multicast address to avoid collisions)

host2 should be started first, then start host1. 
	packet1: host1 (unicast) -> host2(multicast)
	packet2: host2 (unicast) -> host1(unicast)
In all cases, PORT is used both as source and destination (just as stated in RFC 4961)

host1 and host2 can be executed in any host with multicast connectivity between them (preferrably from the same link, 163.117.144/24
